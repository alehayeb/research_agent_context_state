# Complex Research Prompt Construction Framework *Version 1.0 - For Advanced Research Capabilities* ## Executive Summary This framework provides a systematic approach to constructing high-quality research prompts for advanced AI research systems. It synthesizes best practices from academic research, industry implementations, and proven methodologies to enable consistent, reproducible, and high-quality research outputs. --- ## I. Most Impactful Factors for Complex Research Prompts ### 1. **Structured Decomposition & Reasoning Chains** - **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Breaking down complex queries into intermediate reasoning steps significantly improves performance on complex tasks - **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)**: Organizing thoughts into nodes allows for optimal thought path selection and strategic lookahead - **Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT)**: Outlining the answer's skeleton first, then filling details in parallel ### 2. **Source Quality Hierarchization** - **Primary Sources Priority**: Scholarly articles → Technical implementations → Reputable publications - **Authority Scoring**: Peer-reviewed > Government/Official > Industry reports > General media - **Recency Weighting**: Time-sensitive topics require recent sources with exponential decay ### 3. **Contextual Richness & Specification** - **Domain Specificity**: Task-specific instructions and domain expertise significantly enhance model efficacy - **Constraint Definition**: Clear boundaries, scope limitations, and output requirements - **Multi-modal Context**: Integration of structured data, citations, and cross-references ### 4. **Iterative Refinement & Feedback Loops** - **Self-Consistency**: Multiple reasoning paths with voting mechanisms improve reliability - **Validation Checkpoints**: Intermediate verification of reasoning steps - **Error Correction**: Feedback-driven refinement through iterative critique and synthesis ### 5. **Programmatic Structure & Orchestration** - **Modular Design**: Separating interface from implementation enables optimization - **Pipeline Architecture**: Sequential and parallel processing of sub-tasks - **State Management**: Maintaining context across multiple LLM interactions --- ## II.

Analyze the research question for ambiguities 2. Identify potential biases in the framing 3. Suggest 2-3 alternative formulations 4. Proceed with the most comprehensive version [Main Research Prompt] ``` #### 2. **Recursive Refinement Pattern** ```markdown # Iterative Research Protocol Round 1: Initial exploration - Broad search across all source tiers - Identify key themes and gaps Round 2: Targeted deep dive - Focus on gaps from Round 1 - Seek primary sources for key claims - Challenge initial assumptions Round 3: Synthesis and validation - Cross-validate findings - Resolve contradictions - Finalize recommendations ``` #### 3. **Multi-Perspective Pattern** ```markdown # Stakeholder Analysis Framework For each finding, analyze from perspectives of: 1. Academic researchers 2. Industry practitioners 3. End users/beneficiaries 4. Policy makers 5. Critics/skeptics Synthesize into balanced conclusion ``` ### C. **Orchestration Strategies** #### 1. **Sequential Pipeline** ```python # Pseudo-code for research pipeline pipeline = [ {"step": "scope_analysis", "validator": check_clarity}, {"step": "source_discovery", "validator": check_quality}, {"step": "information_extraction", "validator": check_relevance}, {"step": "synthesis", "validator": check_consistency}, {"step": "recommendation_generation", "validator": check_actionability} ] ``` #### 2. **Parallel Exploration** ```markdown # Concurrent Research Streams Stream A: Academic literature review Stream B: Industry implementation analysis Stream C: Emerging trends identification Convergence point: Integrate findings where streams intersect ``` #### 3. **Validation Framework** ```markdown # Quality Metrics - Source Authority Score: [Academic: 3, Implementation: 2, Professional: 1] - Recency Weight: exp(-days_old/365) - Cross-validation Score: num_confirming_sources / total_sources - Confidence Level: weighted_average(source_scores * validation_scores) ``` --- ## III. Implementation Guidelines ### A. **For Simple Research Questions** 1. Use basic CoT with 2-3 reasoning steps 2. Focus on Tier 1-2 sources 3. Single-pass synthesis ### B. **For Complex Multi-Domain Research** 1. Apply full framework with all patterns 2. Use recursive refinement (3+ rounds) 3. Implement parallel exploration streams 4.
